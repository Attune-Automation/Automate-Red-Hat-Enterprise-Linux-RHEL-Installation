As the demands of modern digital infrastructure grow, the need for 
efficient and standardised methods of operating system deployment 
becomes increasingly important.

The Kickstart method is a powerful tool that allows system 
administrators to automate the installation of Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux (RHEL) on multiple machines.

This Attune Project contains Blueprints to create RHEL Kickstart ISOs.

## About Red Hat Enterprise Linux

RHEL stands as a commercial Linux distribution meticulously crafted by Red 
Hat to cater to the business sector. This versatile operating system comes in 
server editions designed for various architectures, including x86-64, Power 
ISA, ARM64, and IBM Z, as well as a desktop edition tailored for x86-64 
systems. The development and innovation for RHEL draw inspiration from Fedora 
Linux and CentOS Stream, which serve as its primary sources for new features 
and enhancements. Red Hat places its paramount emphasis on providing 
comprehensive support, training, and certification programs exclusively 
centered around the RHEL platform.

## Understanding Kickstart Automation

Kickstart is a technology developed by Red Hat that enables 
administrators to automate the installation process of RHEL. 
Instead of manually configuring each installation, Kickstart uses a 
predefined configuration file, commonly referred to as a Kickstart 
file, to specify various installation settings. These settings 
include language preferences, partitioning schemes, package 
selection, network configuration, and more. The Kickstart file 
essentially scripts the installation process, allowing for 
consistent and repeatable deployments.

## Advantages of Automated Kickstarting

Automating the installation of RHEL using Kickstart offers several 
key benefits:

1. **Time Efficiency:** Manual installation can be time-consuming, 
especially when dealing with multiple machines. Kickstart 
automates the process, saving significant time and effort.

2. **Consistency:** Automated installations ensure that each 
instance is configured identically, reducing the risk of errors 
caused by manual intervention.

3. **Reduced Human Error:** Manual installations can lead to 
mistakes or variations in configuration. Kickstart eliminates these 
errors by following a predefined script.

4. **Standardisation:** Kickstart promotes standardized 
configurations across the organization, simplifying management and 
troubleshooting.
