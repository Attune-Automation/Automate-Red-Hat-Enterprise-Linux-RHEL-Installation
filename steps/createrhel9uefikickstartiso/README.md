This Attune Automated blueprint for creating an Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 
UEFI Kickstart ISO is a powerful tool that streamlines and simplifies the 
process of generating customized bootable ISO images for RHEL installations. 
This blueprint automates the creation of UEFI-compatible ISOs, ensuring 
compatibility with modern hardware and systems.

With this solution, users can effortlessly tailor their RHEL installations 
to meet specific requirements, such as pre-configured settings, software 
packages, and system configurations. It provides a seamless and efficient way 
to deploy RHEL8 across a wide range of hardware environments, making it ideal 
for system administrators and IT professionals who seek to automate and 
standardise their deployment processes.

Attune's automated blueprint for RHEL UEFI Kickstart ISOs empowers users to 
save time and effort while maintaining consistency and reliability in their 
Linux deployments, ultimately enhancing productivity and system management 
capabilities.
